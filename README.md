# Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/151614681.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/151614681)

The Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS) is an open-source modular, scalable, and extensive framework for global mean, regional, and extreme sea level projection that is designed to support the characterization of ambiguity in sea-level projections. It is designed so users can easily explore deep uncertainty by investigating the implications on GMSL, RSL, and ESL of different choices for different processes. Its modularity allows components to be represented by either simple or complex model. Because it is built upon the Radical-PILOT computing stack, different modules can be dispatched for execution on resources appropriate to their computational complexity.

FACTS is being developed by the [Earth System Science & Policy Lab](https://www.earthscipol.net) and the [RADICAL Research Group](https://radical.rutgers.edu) at Rutgers University. FACTS is released under the MIT License.

## Hector-FACTS

This is a forked repository of the FACTS project which has been modified to use simple cliamte model [Hector](https://github.com/JGCRI/hector) in addition to Fair in its run. Integrating Hector into FACTS was done by Hector team members Kalyn Dorheim and Ciara Donegan. 


### Installing Hector-FACTS on Your Machine

Prerequisites: git and docker 

#### 1. Install git (if not already installed)

To install git, open your terminal and use the appropriate command for your operating system:

**On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:**

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

**On macOS:** 

```
brew install git
```

**On Windows:**

Install git via the [Git for Windows installer.](https://gitforwindows.org/)

To verify git is installed, run:
```
git --version

```

#### 2. Install docker (if not already installed)

To install docker, follow the instructions for your operating system:

**On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:**

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

**On macOS or Windows:**

Download and install Docker from the official Docker website.

To verify docker is installed, run:
```
docker --version
```

#### 3. Clone the Hector-FACTS repository

Once git is installed, clone the Hector-FACTS repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kdorheim/hector-facts.git
```

Navigate to the Hector-FACTS directory this will be project working direcotry (PROJ_DIR) for the rest of the instructions. 


#### 4. Install Project Data 

From the PROJ_DIR navigate to the modules-data folder and run the following to install the large data files that are stored on zenodo too large to save to github and have to be hosted on zenodo.
```
cd modules-data
wget -i modules-data.urls.txt
```
